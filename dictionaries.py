Create a dictionary containing some information about yourself.
 The keys should include name, age,
  country of birth, favorite language.

 myself={}
name[nme]="My name is Jules"
age[age]="My age is 37"
country[ctry]="My country of birth is  The USA"
favlang[lang]="My favorite language Spanish"


There are two steps to this process, building a dictionary
 and then gathering all the data from it.
    for data in name:
        print data
    for val in in age.itervalues():
        print values
    for key.data in country.iteritems():
        print key, "=", data
    for key in capitals.iterkeys():
        print key    




  Write a function that can take in and print out
   any dictionary keys and values.

   for k, v in d.iteritems():
       print k, d
